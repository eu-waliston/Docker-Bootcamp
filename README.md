# Contents

- Chapter 1, Installing Docker Locally, works through installing the core Docker Engine as well as
supporting tools on macOS, Windows 10, and Linux desktops so that you are ready for the
forthcoming chapters.

- Chapter 2, Launching Applications Using Docker, uses the Docker installation we installed in the
previous chapter and launches containers. By the end of the chapter, we will launch a WordPress
installation both manually and by using Docker Compose to define your multi-container application.
We will also look at how you can publish your own images to Docker Hub.

- Chapter 3, Docker in the Cloud, explains how to move away from your local installation of Docker
and into public clouds. Here, we will look at launching Docker hosts in various public clouds and
also deploy our applications onto them.

- Chapter 4, Docker Swarm, continues to use public clouds; but rather than working with single
isolated Docker hosts, we will deploy and configure a Docker Swarm cluster.

- Chapter 5, Docker Plugins, speaks of the phrases used when describing Docker, which is Batteries
included but removable. In this chapter, we will look at third-party plugins, which extend
coreDocker functionality by adding persistent storage and multi-host networking.

- Chapter 6, Troubleshooting and Monitoring, questions that, now that we have containers running
locally, remotely, and within a cluster, what can go wrong? In this chapter, we will look at some of
the problems you can come across. Also, we will learn how we can deploy tools to get metrics such
as CPU, memory, and HDD utilization from your containers using both, first and third-party tools.

- Chapter 7, Putting It All Together, emphasizes that you should now have a good understanding of
what Docker is, how it works, and some possible use cases. In this chapter, we will explore how you
can share container experience with colleagues as well what steps to take next.
